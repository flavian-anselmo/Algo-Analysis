TIME COMPLEXITY 
#O(n)the loop  runs in linear time 
#O(1)the time comlexity is in constant time 
#O(n)this runs in linear time 
#the print function runs in constant time 
there fore the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n)+O(1)+O(n)
the constant time is canceled 
the time complexity is IN QUADRATIC TIME O(n^2)
